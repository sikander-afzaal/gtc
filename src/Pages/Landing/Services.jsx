            VISION: RURAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH SCREENING OF 75 VILLAGES PAN INDIA
            BY THE END OF DECEMBER 2023{" "}

          <p>
            The pilot project was initiated in August 2021 by DR ANUPAMA
            GOTIMUKULA, MD AAPI PRESIDENT (2021-2022). By the end of December
            2023, we will complete 75 villages across India. This program is
            supported by the current chair for Adopt a Village Dr. Satish
            Kathula (Vice President, AAPI). The project is fully endorsed and
            supported by current president, Dr. RAVI KOLLI.{" "}

            The numbers are alarming with high levels of Kidney Disease,
            Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, Anemia, High Blood pressure and
            Cholesterol and pre-disease states found in the rural population
            (All age groups & Gender). We will continue to screen villages
            across India, and create a road map to provide 'continuous health
            care' with the help of AAPI sponsors, service partners and social
            entrepreneurs. Our goal is to bring the importance of Preventive
            healthcare screening to diagnose and prevent diseases early and, if
            possible, reverse diseases through adjustments in lifestyle for
            non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like HTN, DM, High Cholesterol,
            Anemia, Kidney disease, Obesity & Malnutrition, Chronic Lung
            diseases.{" "}
