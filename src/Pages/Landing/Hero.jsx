          Our initial journey started about 12 years ago when we formed the Indo
          American Telemedicine Corporation. We tried to impact screening of no
          communicable dieses through several models and created significant
          impact with screening through health cube and with our own model of
          screening population in rural and urban areas. And finally, we started
          global teleclinics (GTC) as a separate entity to focus on
          noncommunicable diseases prevention and management.{" "}
