              Our message is loud and clear. While it is worthwhile to switch
              out your plastic water bottles for glass, buy non-GMO products and
              use phthalate-free toothpaste, it is more important to first
              conquer the six habits that can make heart attacks and chronic
              diseases nearly extinct. The number one killer of men and women
              can be tamed with your fork, your feet, your fingers far from
              cigarettes, and some responsible use of a small glass of wine.{" "}

                So it's as easy as simply sticking to these six simple habits:
              </strong>{" "}
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Whole food Plant-based diet</li>
              <li>Regular physical activity</li>
              <li>No smoking and reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption. </li>

              <strong> Quote about plant based diet:</strong> “There is only one
              you and also there is no planet B- If you are concerned about your
              health and planetary health, add more plant on your plates” .
